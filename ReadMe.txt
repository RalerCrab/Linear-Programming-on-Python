This is my first try in this plataform.
My knowledge is negligible and it has no sense to anyone, in fact if something somehow works it will be probably because it's obteined from another source.

The main idea is to create an "program" that can aply an linear algorithm on a linear programming model.
It has as a base a Excel example that i will try to reproduce here.

If you are reading this, you are probably loosing you time in my empty repository.
Howeber, if you have something to comment or add, any coment will be more valuable.

Thank you.
